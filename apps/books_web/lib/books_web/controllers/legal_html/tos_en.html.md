Terms of Service
================

The Altenwald site provides an online book sales service for both the sale of books in physical format (on paper) and digital format (in PDF and ePUB). When making a purchase, you will be asked for your consent and acceptance of these terms (or conditions) of the service provided.

You can also register as a member of the Altenwald community. This membership gives you access to material only available to members such as:

- Reading access of purchased books without downloading.
- Public or private notes in the books.
- Questions and answers about the books.
- Access to private articles on the Altenwald blog.
- Permissions to make public comments or restricted to the community.
- Notifications about updates in books and articles.

These permissions will depend on the level of membership you acquire.

## Purchase of Digital Material

When you buy a book in digital version it will be sent to the payment page and after checking that the payment has been made correctly is redirected to the page where you can download the material. Normally the formats with which we work are:

- [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF), a format that shows the document as a printed book in page size A5, including the cover in the first page.

- [ePUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB), is a format widely used for readers of digital books (ebooks). This format is more flexible and adapts the size of the page to the screen size of the device. It is more convenient to read on smaller devices such as 8 "or smaller tablets and smart mobile phones.

The page link is enabled for you temporarily. However, if you complete the free membership registration you will be able to download the books whenever you need.

## Purchase of Physical Material

Physical books require manual treatment. Once the payment has been made, a notification is issued to prepare the shipment as soon as possible. We sell the books in print on demand. Due to low demand so far. The phases a book goes through are:

- Preparation: the book is in the process of preparation.
- Printing: the book has been processed and the printing order is given.
- Shipping: the book was printed and has been shipped to its destination.

If it is a destination where we can activate tracking, an email and/or SMS will be sent to you with the code for tracking. If not, you will be informed approximately of the date of receipt.

The buyer is responsible for providing all correct data. The email will be used to send notifications regarding the aforementioned phases.

The data referring to the buyer's address and telephone number will be stored solely for the purpose of making the shipment. The buyer agrees that Altenwald transfers this data to the shipping company for the processing and execution of the shipment.

## Invoices

As we mentioned in the previous sections, the default invoices are issued simplified. You can request the aggregation of customer data on the invoice at the time of purchase. For digital purchases you will have to send an email with the company data (company name, full address and tax identification in the case of a European company attached to VIES). For purchases of physical material, simply respond with the data to be included in the invoice in the first notification.

## Presale

When you purchase pre-sale material you will usually have access to a draft. The draft will be modified during the entire period of the pre-sale period until it becomes a final version.

Purchases made in this period will have a price lower than the final sale price.

The notification of new modifications will be periodic but not fixed. When new modifications are available they will be sent to the buyers.

## Inclusion in newsletters

The publication of errata, new presale versions and other notifications related to previously purchased books are made through a newsletter. We use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) to send these notifications. You will only receive notifications of the material that you have purchased and you can unsubscribe at any time through a link available in the same notifications.

Please note that by canceling these notifications you revoke your right to receive updates of the material received as well as discounts on other materials.

## Return and Refund

No refunds. In case of digital material, the file can be re-sent if it is not correct. In case of physical material can be replaced by a new one if the book is defective or arrived in terrible conditions.
